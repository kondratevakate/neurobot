Baseline machine learning models for neuroimaging vectorized data: **Neuroimaging Baseline Bot**

Plug-and-play pipeline for classification models with adaptive `grid-search`, `dimensionality reduction`,  `model selection` with extensive validation. Helpful for small samples with **high-dimensional** feature set, and written for classification on **morphometrical** or **functional connectivity** data in MRI studies. Yet suitable for all small samples with lots of correlated features.

Model validation includes `repeated cross-validation`, `loo validation`, and `bootstrapping` to ensure model stability.
